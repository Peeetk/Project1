      I think I was overthinking this project at first. I did not understand
      what was really needed to put it together, but luckily I have a really good
      mentor. His name is Nathen, and he helped me a lot to describe what the job actually is.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was thinking a lot about the best way to build a webpage.
      Should I make the HTML first and then add the style after, or work on both at
      the same time? Finally, I decided to work on both HTML and CSS simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a little confusing figuring out why things werenâ€™t working, but then it
      all came together.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have used some examples from Codecademy and images from the internet, but most
      of the work is my own.
    </p>

    <p>I really hope that this project meets all the criteria.</p>
